class Solution:
    def checkPossibility(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:        
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
                count += 1
                
                if count > 1 or ((i-1>=0 and nums[i-1] > nums[i+1]) and (i+2<len(nums) and nums[i] > nums[i+2])):
                    return False
        return True

# What's in the condition to return False is important
# You can edit nums[i] or nums[i+1] to have a non-decreasing array
